# Custom layout

After you have executed the setup script, you have one gradle repository, `$KATA_USERNAME-generic-gradle-1`.
The standard layout for such a repository is the following:

```
[org]/[module]/[baseRev](-[folderItegRev])/[module]-[baseRev](-[fileItegRev])(-[classifier]).[ext]
```

If you look into the repository, you see that you have two artifacts: `duck-1.0.0.jpg` and `fox-1.0.0.jpg`, both in the `acme/<artifact_name>/<artifact_version>/` folder.

You have a team that wants to have all ducks and fox artifacts with the same version in the same folder named after their version so that they look like the following:

```bash
.
└── acme
   └── 1.0.0
       ├── duck-1.0.0.jpg
       └── fox-1.0.0.jpg

```

> **NOTE:** Artifactory does not translate across layouts when copying or moving. Therefore, try to use the same layouts across any given artifacts lifecycle.


## Tasks

**Make the layout and repository**

* First we will need to create a layout. In Artifactory, got to [Admin] —> [Repositories] —> [Layout], then click on "Duplicate" from the gradle layout.
* Give a name to "Layout Name", in our case it will be called something with your initials.
* In the "Artifact Path Pattern", delete the first `/[module]` that represents a folder structure.
* Test that the layout works as intended. In "Test Artifacts Path Resolution", fill in the following: `acme/1.0.0/fox-1.0.0.jpg`
* Click the `Test` button and check that you get the following resolution:

```
Organization:acme
Module:fox
Base Revision: 1.0.0
Folder Integration Revision:
File Integration Revision:
Classifier:
Extension:jpg
Type:
```

* Save the layout
* Now we need to make a repository. Go to [Admin] —> [Repositories] —> [Local], then click "New" -> choose the Gradle icon.
* Name the repository something starting with your initials.
* From “Repository Layout” dropdown list we will choose our recently created custom layout.
* Leave the rest of the windows as is, and then hit “ Save & Finish” button.

**Upload the files**

* Go to the repository browser, click on the repository and click deploy
* Upload both duck and fox images with the "deploy according to layout" option. You will have to upload them 1 at a time to deploy according to layout.

    Fill in the info: `org: acme, baseRev: 1.0.0, module: duck or fox`
* Check that they get the `Dependency Declaration` section in the UI when selecting them.

**Add the dependencies**

* Go into your `build.gradle` and change your repository to the URL of the new repository.

    **Info:** When you paste your repository name into `build.gradle`, notice the `ivy` section. This is normally something you would have to write yourself when resolving custom repositories, as Artifactory cannot automatically translate the default maven paths that Gradle automatically uses. This workaround allows Gradle to search the custom layout.

* Execute `gradle copyDeps`
* Look into the `build/output` folder to see that the artifacts have been downloaded as they should.
